# dark-mode-sandbox

A sandbox to try out different approaches for implementing color mode toggles (dark / light)

- `gatsby-body-class`: color mode is controlled by toggling the `class` name ('dark', 'light') of the `body` element. Implemented in Gatsy, inspired by [overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) by Dan Abramov.
- `gatsby-root-style`: color mode is controlled by setting the style properties to the `root` element. Implementation in Gatsby by [Josh Comeau](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/dark-mode-minimal).
